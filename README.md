# Flask ML Application

This project is a Flask-based web application that integrates multiple machine learning models, offering various features including sentiment analysis, image classification, and a chatbot interface using GPT-2.

## Features

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis**
- Users can input text, and the application will utilize Hugging Face’s sentiment analysis pipeline to predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative, along with a confidence score.

### 2. **Image Classification**
- Users can upload an image, and the application will classify it into one of 1,000 ImageNet categories using a pretrained DenseNet121 model. The top 5 predictions, along with their confidence scores, will be displayed.

### 3. **Chatbot**
- Users can chat with a GPT-2-based chatbot that generates conversational responses to user input.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download ImageNet Classes**:
   Ensure the `imagenet_classes.txt` file is present in the root directory of the project. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/pytorch/hub/blob/master/imagenet_classes.txt).

5. **Run the Flask Server**:
   Start the Flask application.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Sentiment Analysis
1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. Select **Sentiment Analysis** from the dropdown.
3. Input text and click **Submit**.
4. The sentiment prediction and confidence score will be displayed.

### Image Classification
1. Select **Image Classification** from the dropdown.
2. Upload an image and click **Submit**.
3. The top 5 predictions with their probabilities will be displayed.

### Chatbot
1. Select **Chat** from the dropdown.
2. Type a message and submit it.
3. A response generated by the GPT-2 model will be displayed.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more ML models and features.
- Improve the chatbot's conversational accuracy by upgrading to a more advanced model (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4).
- Enhance the user interface for a more modern and seamless experience.
- Improve code maintainability by modularizing components further and adhering to best practices.
