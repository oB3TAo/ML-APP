# Flask ML Application

This project is a Flask web application that integrates multiple machine learning models to provide a variety of features:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user-provided text and predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images uploaded by the user into categories using a pretrained DenseNet121 model.
- **Chatbot**: Provides chat functionality using the Mistral-7B language model.

## Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:  
   Users can input text, and the application will use a Hugging Face sentiment analysis pipeline to predict the sentiment and provide a confidence score.

2. **Image Classification**:  
   Users can upload an image, which will be classified into one of 1,000 ImageNet categories using a pretrained DenseNet121 model. The top 5 predictions along with their confidence scores will be displayed.

3. **Chatbot**:  
   Users can interact with a chatbot based on the Mistral-7B language model. It generates a response to user inputs in a conversational manner.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download ImageNet classes**:
   Ensure you have the `imagenet_classes.txt` file in the root of your project directory. You can get it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt).

5. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
